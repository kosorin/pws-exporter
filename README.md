# PWS Exporter

PWS Exporter exports data (backup) from Wunderground using its API. 

## Usage

    PwsExporter.exe <api-key> <station-id> <start-date> [<end-date>]

### Example

    PwsExporter.exe <your-api-key> IPRAGU100 2019-05-01 2021-11-22

## Output

Output files are saved in the following structure: `./out/<station-id>/<year>/<month>/<date>.json`

## Wunderground API key

You can generate an API key in [Wunderground settings](https://www.wunderground.com/member/api-keys).

### API limitation

> Unfortunately, Wunderground.com does not offer unrestricted access to the data of a PWS. API Keys are basically limited in use as follows:
> - A maximum of 1500 calls per day
> - A maximum of 30 calls per minute

To prevent the limit from exceeded, the program calls the API only every 2200 milliseconds.
This means that one year's export will take approximately 15-20 minutes (365 days Ã— 2-3 seconds).
Also you should not export more than 4 years per day (1500 calls / 365 days).
